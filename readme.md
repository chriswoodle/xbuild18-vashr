# About

This project was created at [Xbuild 2018](http://www.auvsi.org/xbuild). 

It is a surveying and response UAV swarm system that both surveys areas for danger and risks, and deploys a UAV w/payload to targeted locations.

For the event, the system was designed to handle three scenarios:
1.	Detect boats in water
2.	Detect sharks in water
3.	Detect someone drowning

The system uses IBM Watson for image recognition of the above targets.

The system consists of several microservices and components. 
* base-station-hardware
* base-station-image
* base-station-voice
* controller
* sky-crane

It was developed in parts to save time during the event by reducing risk through code feature seperation.
